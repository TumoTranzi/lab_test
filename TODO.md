# TODO: Enhance Home Page for Better Looks and User-Friendliness

## Tasks
- [x] Update Home.js: Modify hero section text to be more engaging and add a subtle background gradient.
- [x] Update Home.js: Add a new "Popular Movies" section with placeholder movie cards for dynamism.
- [x] Update Home.css: Modernize color palette (e.g., dark theme with vibrant accents), improve typography, add smooth animations, and enhance mobile responsiveness.
- [x] Update Home.css: Make buttons more prominent with better hover effects and sizing.
- [x] Test the changes by running the React app and verifying the UI in the browser.

## Notes
- Ensure changes are compatible with existing components.
- Use React best practices for the new section.
- CSS should be responsive for mobile devices.
- The React app is now running on a different port (likely 3001) due to port 3000 being occupied.
